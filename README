These are my solutions for Project Euler problems.

For the most part, I follow the 60 second rule, i.e. all the programs must run in below 60 seconds.

For the most part, my solutions are solved as quickly as I can. As such, most of my solutions are solved using brute-force (and are very messy at that).  Some solutions are omitted because they did not require programming.
